    "## Overview\n",
    "This process will allow a more streamlined way for ingesting data into cloud storage. Rather than manually uploading the data, we will use the Cloud Shell to ingest data into the bucket. This will require having already worked through the  Setting up the Cloud Shell Lab and setting up the Google Cloud SDK.\n",

    "**If you are using Qwiklabs for this course, you can not run this from your local terminal. Run the following instructions in Cloud Shell.**\n",
